## SafeNet
Made to be a one and done net library replacement, SafeNet will automatically stream all data if it is too large to be sent immediately. You can use it the same way you use the native Starfall net utils and it has full backwards compatibility. You can just insert <addr>local net = safeNet</addr> at the top of the code and not change anything and it will work perfectly.
